# givEth

givEth is a web app that allows users to securely and anonymously request and send donations to charitable causes. We believe that all people, regardless of their situation - whether that be their legal status, access to banks (often a prerequisite for other donation sources), or ability to present themselves and their cases safely in public - deserve the right to ask for and send help to others. Often, it's precisely those people whose safety requires anonymity or who do not have access to traditional financial institutions that need this help the most.

To use our app, please visit [http://giv-eth.herokuapp.com/](http://giv-eth.herokuapp.com/). Prior to creating or donating to a campaign, you must download the MetaMask browser extension. Instructions for how to do this can be found on our [about page](http://giv-eth.herokuapp.com/about) or in [Meta Mask's documentation](https://metamask.io/download.html). Once you've set up your wallet, you're ready to go!

If you're running the application locally in a testing environment, please download [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) using [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/overview) as your local development blockchain. Follow step 3 of [this guide](https://medium.com/@adamh90/creating-a-local-test-environment-for-ethereum-smart-contracts-1f638efca020) for how to connect your MetaMask wallet with your Ganache chain.
